# Knight Shift

## Product Overview

Knight Shift is a lightweight desktop companion RPG that lives in a small corner of the user's screen while they work, browse, code, write, create, chat, or play.

The player's real computer activity powers the royal influence office of the Aethernet Kingdom. Every meaningful action at the computer can become progress for the royal court's marketing machine, but the game should never demand constant direct interaction.

Unlike traditional idle games, Knight Shift does not generate progress passively. Progress comes from real keyboard and mouse activity while the app is running.

The central prototype question remains:

Does earning progress from real-world keyboard and mouse activity feel satisfying?

---

## Core Loop

1. The player types, clicks, scrolls, and uses their computer normally.
2. Inputs generate Influence.
3. Influence can be spent on:
   - Power upgrades that improve Influence generation.
   - Cosmetics that customize the scene.
4. The same earned Influence is also counted as XP.
5. XP increases Level.
6. Level unlocks:
   - Random cosmetic rewards.
   - New shop categories.
   - New scene expansions.

This separates spendable balance from lifetime progression:

- Influence: current spendable balance after purchases.
- XP: lifetime earned Influence in the current save.
- Level: unlock gate and reward cadence.
- Cosmetics: visible status and personal expression.
- Scene: the living visual record of the player's progress.

---

## Core Design Principles

## Real Activity Drives Progress

The game rewards normal computer use.

Examples:

- Typing code.
- Writing documents.
- Browsing the web.
- Playing games.
- Using creative software.
- Chatting with friends.

The player should never need to actively click the game window to grind progress.

## No Passive Idle Economy

Knight Shift must not become a timer farm.

Avoid:

- Passive currency generation.
- Login rewards.
- Energy systems.
- Time gates.
- Fear-of-missing-out mechanics.
- Exponential click inflation.
- Scientific notation currency.

## Progression Through Systems and Expression

The game can become deeper and more rewarding over time, but it should not rely on making every click worth absurd amounts.

Progression should come from:

- Better input-driven rewards.
- New shop categories.
- Cosmetic collections.
- Scene expansions.
- Character upgrades.
- Visual transformation.
- Unlocking more things to customize.

---

## Setting

Knight Shift is set in the Aethernet Kingdom, a fantasy medieval kingdom where modern corporate technology exists alongside magic.

The world should feel absurd, comedic, and workplace-adjacent:

- Knights carry smartphones.
- Wizards process spreadsheets.
- Dragons deliver packages.
- Castles become data centers.
- Royal offices become corporate departments.
- Arcane infrastructure powers the internet-equivalent Aethernet.

The player is not a chosen hero.

The player starts as a low-level fantasy-corporate nobody contracted by the royal court, then gradually builds influence until the court's tiny marketing desk becomes an absurd castle-campus media empire.

---

## Player Role

The player begins as a shabby royal marketing hire with almost nothing:

- Dented armor.
- Rusty sword.
- Tiny patch of grass.
- Broken wooden sign.
- Empty background.

The starting state should feel intentionally pathetic.

The long-term fantasy is not becoming a traditional hero. It is building enough cultural, social, and organizational influence to transform a sad little royal marketing desk into the Aethernet Kingdom's most powerful influence operation.

---

## Progression Model

## Influence

Influence is the spendable currency.

Influence is earned from real input activity and spent on:

- Power upgrades.
- Cosmetics.
- Scene customization.
- Future systems.

Current foundation:

- 1 keypress = 1 Influence earned = 1 XP.
- 1 mouse click = 1 Influence earned = 1 XP.

Future systems may add bonuses, bundles, procs, or upgrade-driven gains, but all generation must trace back to real user activity.

Current Influence is the player's spendable balance:

Current Influence = lifetime earned Influence - spent Influence.

## XP and Level

Influence is XP.

XP is the lifetime total of earned Influence in the current save.

In the current foundation, XP is equivalent to the total number of counted inputs:

XP = lifetime keypresses + lifetime mouse clicks.

Spending Influence does not reduce XP.

XP increases account Level.

Initial level curve:

- Level 1 starts at 0 XP.
- Level 2 starts at 500 XP.
- Level 3 starts at 1,500 XP.
- Level 4 starts at 6,000 XP.
- Level 5 starts at 30,000 XP.
- Later levels should use nonlinear increasing requirements tuned around the expected multi-week progression timeline.

XP requirements should be displayed as lifetime totals. For example, Level 2 begins at 500 XP, and the Level 2 progress span runs from 500 total XP to 1,500 total XP.

Early tuning intent:

- Level 1 to Level 2 should take roughly 5 minutes of passive real computer activity.
- Level 2 to Level 3 currently feels acceptable and should remain close to the current pacing.
- Level 4 should feel like the first longer-session milestone.
- Level 5 should feel like the first multi-hour milestone.

Level unlocks:

- Random cosmetic rewards.
- New shop categories.
- Scene expansions.
- Milestone rewards.

Level should make long-term progress legible even when Influence is spent.

## Title Progression

Levels also grant a fantasy-corporate title. Titles are visible progression labels that make account status readable before the full scene exists.

- Aetherlord of Messaging: "Entire markets panic when the court account posts"
- Kingmaker: "Influence has surpassed authority"

## Power Upgrades

Power upgrades affect Influence generation or reward opportunities.

They should be carefully designed so they enhance real activity rather than replacing it.

Examples:

- Bonus Influence bundles triggered by random activity procs.
- Improved reward chances.
- More event variety.
- Better activity-based procs.

Power upgrades should not create passive idle income.

Power upgrade procs should use random percent chances per real input rather than fixed input intervals. Early items should fire fairly often for small rewards; later items should become rarer jackpot-style events with much larger rewards.

Proc rolls should be batched. Raw input handlers should only enqueue eligible inputs, and the game should drain those queued rolls on a short cooldown window, currently about once per second. Every eligible input still receives its chance, but random calculations should not run directly inside each keyboard or mouse event handler.

## Functional Shop Item Ladder

The following functional shop items are planned progression unlocks. Items can be purchased and stored before their effects are implemented.

Status-only shop item:

- Level 2: Royal Contract.
  - Cost: 100 Influence.
  - The player pays 100 Influence to bribe a court official for a royal contract.
  - This makes the player the marketing manager for the Aethernet royal court.
  - This item has no mechanical effect.
  - If the player's current title is Court Marketing Intern, it changes to Court Marketing Manager.
  - Required before any other shop items appear.

## Cosmetics

Cosmetics are visible status and progression.

They should become one of the main reasons to keep playing.

Cosmetics do not need to be equipped through deep menus. The player is decorating a living diorama.

---

## The Scene

The scene is the player's kingdom, office, home, and status symbol in one compact desktop companion window.

It is always visible in the small game window.

The player should be able to look at a screenshot and roughly estimate progression.

## Level 1 Scene

Very humble:

- One shabby knight.
- Dented armor.
- Rusty sword.
- Tiny patch of grass.
- Broken wooden sign.
- Empty background.

It should look intentionally low-status.

## Long-Term Scene Transformation

The scene should gradually evolve from:

1. Roadside camp.
2. Small cottage.
3. Royal marketing office.
4. Town hall.
5. Castle.
6. Corporate citadel.
7. Floating techno-magical metropolis.

By endgame, the scene should look absurd:

- A ruler at a glowing workstation.
- Wizards processing spreadsheets.
- Knights carrying servers.
- Floating crystal Wi-Fi towers.
- Arcane IT department.
- Massive castle-datacenter hybrid.

The joke is that the player started with a rusty sword and eventually built the fantasy equivalent of a multinational tech corporation.

---

- Level 50: Town hall.
- Level 100: Castle.

---

---

Level unlocks should create anticipation and make the next category feel meaningful.

Example structure:

- Level 1: Basic Supplies.
  - Armor skins.
  - Weapons.
  - Grass decorations.
- Level 10: Housing.
  - Huts.
  - Cottages.
  - Gardens.
- Level 25: Town Life.
  - Merchants.
  - Citizens.
  - Wagons.
- Level 50: Magic District.
  - Wizards.
  - Portals.
  - Enchantments.
- Level 100: Corporate Kingdom.
  - Cubicles.
  - Arcane servers.
  - Crystal monitors.
- Level 250: Aethernet Division.
  - Data towers.
  - Flying routers.
  - Spell-powered cloud infrastructure.

---

## Expected Progression Feel

## Week 1

The player may have:

- Level 15-25.
- Cottage.
- A few decorations.
- Better armor.
- One companion.

The scene starts to feel alive.

## Week 2

The player may have:

- Level 40-60.
- Small town.
- NPC workers.
- Blacksmith.
- Mage office.

The scene begins animating more.

## Week 3

The player may have:

- Level 75-100.
- Large headquarters.
- Multiple NPCs.
- Emerging fantasy-corporate theme.

## Week 4+

The player may have:

- Castle-campus hybrid.
- Many decorations.
- Complex scene.
- Distinct personal style.

---

## User Interface

Knight Shift is not a full-screen game.

The app should remain a tiny desktop companion, roughly 250x250 to 400x400 pixels for normal operation, expanding only when necessary for menus or panels.

The game should sit comfortably:

- In a screen corner.
- Above a taskbar.
- On a secondary monitor.
- As an overlay while gaming.

The scene remains the primary visual surface.

## GUI Mode Development Baseline

Before the art-driven scene exists, Knight Shift should continue development as a complete assetless GUI-mode game.

GUI mode is not a disposable mockup. It is the functional version of the game without art assets.

All core systems should be playable and testable in GUI mode first:

- Influence, XP, and Level.
- Notifications.
- Shop categories.
- Purchase confirmation.
- Inventory-driven unlocks.
- Level-up rewards.
- Settings and dev tools.
- Future cosmetic ownership and selection.

When the real scene and art assets are added, the art-driven game should port the GUI-mode functionality 1:1.

This means:

- Full mode and GUI mode should receive the same features and functionality until a specific difference is intentionally requested.
- Every GUI control should either remain available or receive a clear equivalent in the art-driven scene.
- The scene should decorate and express progression, not hide or replace critical game state.
- Gameplay systems should not depend on final art being ready.
- UI behavior should be validated in GUI mode before being represented through art, animation, or scene interactions.

GUI mode may eventually become a debug, accessibility, fallback, or low-resource presentation mode.

---

## Technical Requirements

## Performance

Knight Shift must remain extremely lightweight.

Goals:

- Minimal CPU usage.
- Minimal memory usage.
- No noticeable impact on gaming performance.
- Low battery consumption.

Visual updates should be batched and should not process directly in response to every input event.

## Privacy

The app must never store typed content.

Input tracking may count:

- Keypress total.
- Mouse click total.
- Future aggregate activity totals.

Do not store:

- Key contents.
- Typed text.
- Screenshots.
- URLs.
- App names.
- Active window titles.

## Proposed Technology Stack

Desktop shell:

- Tauri.

Frontend:

- Svelte.

Game logic:

- TypeScript for frontend display and interaction logic.
- Rust for authoritative input counting, persistence, and privileged desktop behavior.

Persistence:

- JSON save files for prototype.
- SQLite can be considered later if save complexity grows.

Rendering:

- Canvas or PixiJS for the small animated scene.
- PixiJS is preferred when the scene becomes animated and asset-heavy.

---

## Prototype Direction

Current prototype priority:

1. Real input tracking.
2. Influence as spendable currency.
3. Persistence.
4. Shop and purchase flow.
5. Invisible inventory categories.
6. Basic level and XP system.
7. First visible scene.
8. Cosmetic reward loop.

Do not build broad content before the core activity-to-progress loop feels good.
